# SudokuSolver

I'm a big fan of Sudoku puzzles. I've implemented this program in order to exercise the use of algorithms that use recursive methods. 
With the first version (1.0), the program took as input a Sudoku puzzle, attempted to solve it and printed out the final result.

I've now added new functionalities to make it more interactable.
The game now allows you to:
- Generate a new Sudoku puzzle based on 3 levels of difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard);
- Allows you time to solve it on your own;
- Displays the solution on screen.
